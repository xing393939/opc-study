Tenancy

To meet special regulatory requirements, your organization’s instances might need an 
extra level of isolation. The Dedicated Instance option ensures that your instance will run 
on a dedicated physical server. This means that it won’t be sharing the server with resources
owned by a different customer account. The Dedicated Host option allows you to actually 
identify and control the physical server you’ve been assigned to meet more restrictive 
licensing or regulatory requirements.

dedicated

adj. 专用的

restrictive

adj. 限制的

tenancy

n. 租用

Resource Tags

The more resources you deploy on your AWS account, the harder it can be to properly keep 
track of things. Having constantly changing numbers of EC2 instances—along with accompanying 
storage volumes, security groups, and elastic IP addresses—all spread across two 
or three VPCs can get complicated.

constantly
美[ˈkɑːnstəntli]
adv. 时常地

accompanying
美[ə'kʌmpənɪɪŋ]
adj. 陪伴的

complicated
美[ˈkɑːmplɪkeɪtɪd]
adj. 复杂的

NAT Devices

One solution is to use network address translation (NAT) to give your private instance 
access to the Internet without allowing access to it from the Internet. AWS gives you two 
ways to do that: a NAT instance and a NAT gateway (see Figure 2.2). They’ll both do the 
job, but since a NAT gateway is a managed service, it doesn’t require that you manually 
launch and maintain an instance. Both approaches will incur monthly charges.

approach
美[əˈproʊtʃ]
n. 方法

charge
美[tʃɑːrdʒ]
n. 收费
```

Health Checks Against Application Instances

A good design practice is to have a few recovery actions that work for a 
variety of circumstances. An instance may crash due to an out-of-memory 
condition, a bug, a deleted file, or an isolated network failure, but simply 
terminating and replacing the instance using Auto Scaling resolves all these 
cases. There’s no need to come up with a separate recovery action for each 
cause when simply re-creating the instance solves them all.

variety
美[vəˈraɪəti]

circumstance

n. 条件；环境

Summary

EC2 Auto Scaling can help you avoid application failures caused by overloaded 
instances. By implementing dynamic scaling policies, you can ensure that you always have 
enough instances to handle increased demand. In the event of some failure, a well-designed 
Auto Scaling group will ensure that you always have a minimum number of healthy 
instances. When an instance becomes unhealthy, Auto Scaling will terminate and replace it.
