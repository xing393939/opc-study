Tenancy

To meet special regulatory requirements, your organization’s instances might need an 
extra level of isolation. The Dedicated Instance option ensures that your instance will run 
on a dedicated physical server. This means that it won’t be sharing the server with resources
owned by a different customer account. The Dedicated Host option allows you to actually 
identify and control the physical server you’ve been assigned to meet more restrictive 
licensing or regulatory requirements.

Resource Tags

The more resources you deploy on your AWS account, the harder it can be to properly keep 
track of things. Having constantly changing numbers of EC2 instances—along with accompanying 
storage volumes, security groups, and elastic IP addresses—all spread across two 
or three VPCs can get complicated.
