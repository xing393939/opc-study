#### Chapter 2 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Amazon Elastic Block Store
```
Tenancy

To meet special regulatory requirements, your organization’s instances might need an 
extra level of isolation. The Dedicated Instance option ensures that your instance will run 
on a dedicated physical server. This means that it won’t be sharing the server with resources
owned by a different customer account. The Dedicated Host option allows you to actually 
identify and control the physical server you’ve been assigned to meet more restrictive 
licensing or regulatory requirements.

dedicated
美[ˈdedɪkeɪtɪd]
adj. 专用的

restrictive
美[rɪˈstrɪktɪv]
adj. 限制的

tenancy
美[ˈtɛnənsi]
n. 租用
```

```
Resource Tags

The more resources you deploy on your AWS account, the harder it can be to properly keep 
track of things. Having constantly changing numbers of EC2 instances—along with accompanying 
storage volumes, security groups, and elastic IP addresses—all spread across two 
or three VPCs can get complicated.

constantly
美[ˈkɑːnstəntli]
adv. 时常地

accompanying
美[ə'kʌmpənɪɪŋ]
adj. 陪伴的

complicated
美[ˈkɑːmplɪkeɪtɪd]
adj. 复杂的
```

```
NAT Devices

One solution is to use network address translation (NAT) to give your private instance 
access to the Internet without allowing access to it from the Internet. AWS gives you two 
ways to do that: a NAT instance and a NAT gateway (see Figure 2.2). They’ll both do the 
job, but since a NAT gateway is a managed service, it doesn’t require that you manually 
launch and maintain an instance. Both approaches will incur monthly charges.

approach
美[əˈproʊtʃ]
n. 方法

charge
美[tʃɑːrdʒ]
n. 收费
```

```
Health Checks Against Application Instances

A good design practice is to have a few recovery actions that work for a 
variety of circumstances. An instance may crash due to an out-of-memory 
condition, a bug, a deleted file, or an isolated network failure, but simply 
terminating and replacing the instance using Auto Scaling resolves all these 
cases. There’s no need to come up with a separate recovery action for each 
cause when simply re-creating the instance solves them all.

variety
美[vəˈraɪəti]
n. 多种多样

circumstance
美[ˈsɜːrkəmstæns]
n. 条件；环境

separate
美[ˈsepəreɪt]
adj. 独立的
```

```
Summary

EC2 Auto Scaling can help you avoid application failures caused by overloaded 
instances. By implementing dynamic scaling policies, you can ensure that you always have 
enough instances to handle increased demand. In the event of some failure, a well-designed 
Auto Scaling group will ensure that you always have a minimum number of healthy 
instances. When an instance becomes unhealthy, Auto Scaling will terminate and replace it.

#### Chapter 3 AWS Storage

```
Introduction

In this chapter, you’re going to learn the following:
■ How S3 objects are saved, managed, and accessed
■ How to choose from among the various classes of storage to get the right balance of 
durability, availability, and cost
■ How to manage long-term data storage lifecycles by incorporating Amazon Glacier 
into your design
■ What other AWS services exist to help you with your data storage and access 
operations

durability
美[ˌdjʊrəˈbɪlətɪ]
n. 持久性

incorporate
美[ɪnˈkɔːrpəreɪt]
vt. 使混合
```

```
Eventually Consistent Data

It’s important to bear in mind that S3 replicates data across multiple locations. As a result, 
there might be brief delays while updates to existing objects propagate across the system. 
Uploading a new version of a file or, alternatively, deleting an old file altogether can result 
in one site reflecting the new state with another still unaware of any changes.

To ensure that there’s never a conflict between versions of a single object—which could 
lead to serious data and application corruption—you should treat your data according to 
an eventually consistent standard. That is, you should expect a delay (usually just two seconds 
or less) and design your operations accordingly.

Because there isn’t the risk of corruption when creating new objects, S3 provides read-after-write 
consistency for creation (PUT) operations. （针对new object，把请求发给固定的副本，保证客户端写后能立马读到它。）

bear
美[ber]
v. 带有，拥有

replicate

vt. 复制

brief

n. 腐败

accordingly
美[əˈkɔːrdɪŋli]
adv. 相应地
```

```
Accessing S3 Objects

There is more than a little overlap between those three approaches. In fact, ACLs are 
really leftovers from before AWS created IAM. As a rule, Amazon recommends applying S3 
bucket policies or IAM policies instead of ACLs.

overlap
英[ˌəʊvəˈlæp]
vt. 重叠

approach
美[əˈproʊtʃ]
n. 方法
```

```
Summary

You can reduce the size and cost of your requests against S3 and Glacier-based data by 
leveraging the SQL-like Select feature. You can also provide inexpensive and simple static 
websites through S3 buckets.

Amazon Glacier stores your data archives in vaults that might require hours to retrieve 
but that cost considerably less than the S3 storage classes.

leverage
美[ˈlevərɪdʒ]
v. 发挥杠杆作用；利用

#### Chapter 5 Database Services

```
General-Purpose SSD
Burst duration in seconds = Credit balance / 3000 - 3 * (size in GB)
如果有200GB的gp2磁盘，基准可达到600IOPS，Credit balance上限是5400000
如果Credit balance为0，每秒可以积累600个
如果Credit balance为5400000，要突发到3000IOPS，可以持续2250秒

Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
The ratio of storage in gigabytes to IOPS must be at least 50:1. For example, if you want 32,000 IOPS, 
you must provision at least 640 GB of storage.

The st1 and sc1 volume types are appropriate for frequent, sequential reads 
and writes, such as you might see with data warehousing, extract, transform, 
and load (ETL), and Elastic MapReduce (EMR) applications. These 
volume types are not appropriate for random I/O. For that, gp2 is a better 
choice.

Both RDS MySQL and Aurora MySQL support Cross-Region.
Aurora MySQL support maximum of 4 instances in a multi-master cluster, can't enable cross-Region replicas.
IAM authentication isn’t supported for Oracle.
Multi-region failover, isn’t supported for MS-SQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle.
Multi-region failover, standby instance is not a read replica and cannot serve read traffic. When a failover occurs, RDS changes the DNS record of the endpoint to point to the standby.
Point-in-time recovery for RDS, should enable automatic backups, recovery to fixed backup snapshot.
Point-in-time recovery for Aurora, recovery to any time with-in the backup retention period.
```

```
DynamoDB
https://www.modb.pro/db/65288
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56051481

表有三种索引：
Table Primary Key（必须）
Global Secondary Index（可选，可以选择任意属性作为HashKey和RangeKey）
Local Secondary Index（可选，只能选择与表相同的HashKey，创建表时指定，和表共享吞吐量，最大10G）

索引的两种组成类型：
只包含HashKey：HashKey又称为分区键
包含HashKey+RangeKey组合，RangeKey也称排序键

HashKey、RangeKey的类型只能是String、Number、Binary

DynamoDB的where查询超过2个字段，则建一个冗余的联合字段，然后设置Global Secondary Index或Local Secondary Index
```

```
DynamoDB Global Tables 

To use global tables, your table must be configured in on-demand mode or provisioned 
mode with Auto Scaling enabled. A global table is a collection of replica tables, and 
a global table can have only one replica table per region. Whenever you write an item to a 
replica table, it’s replicated to replica tables in other regions. Global tables don’t support 
strongly consistent read across regions.
```

```
Summary

Whether you implement a relational or nonrelational database depends solely on the 
application that will use it. Relational databases have been around a long time, and many 
application developers default to modeling their data to fit into a relational database. Applications 
use database-specific SDKs to interact with the database, so often the needs of the 
application mandate the specific database engine required. This is why AWS RDS offers six 
of the most popular database engines and sports compatibility with a wide range of versions. 
The idea is to let you take an existing database and port it to RDS without having to 
make any changes to the application.

#### Chapter 8 The Domain Name System and Network Routing: Amazon Route 53 and Amazon CloudFront

```
Routing Policies

1. Simple is the default routing policy for new record sets.
2. Weighted Routing 
3. Latency Routing. Base on your resources running in multiple AWS regions
4. Failover Routing. Set to redirect traffic to a backup resource when primary resource is offline
5. Geolocation Routing. Restrict content to regions where it’s legally permitted
6. Multivalue Answer Routing. 每个A记录对应一个ip和一个healthCheck, failover就剔除，类似ALB
```

```
Summary

Weighted routing policies let you direct traffic among multiple parallel resources proportionally according to their ability to handle it. Latency routing policies send traffic to 
multiple resources to provide the lowest-latency service possible. Failover routing monitors a resource and, on failure, reroutes subsequent traffic to a backup resource. Geolocation routing assesses the location of a request source and directs responses to appropriate 
resources.

Amazon CloudFront is a CDN that caches content at edge locations to provide lowlatency delivery of websites and digital media.

parallel
美[ˈpærəlel]
adj. 并行的

subsequent
美[ˈsʌbsɪkwənt]

#### Chapter 9 Simple Queue Service and Kinesis

```
Kinesis Data Firehose vs. Kinesis Data Streams

Kinesis Data Firehose, on the other hand, is not an open-ended producer-consumer 
model where a consumer can simply subscribe to a stream. Instead, you must specify one or 
more destinations for the data.

Kinesis Data Firehose is tightly integrated with managed AWS services and third-party 
applications, so it’s generally more appropriate for streaming data to services such
as Redshift, S3, or Splunk. Kinesis Data Streams, on the other hand, is usually the better 
choice for streaming data to a custom application. Refer to Table 9.1 for a comparison of 
SQS and Kinesis services.

open-ended
美[ˈopənˈɛndɪd]
adj. 广泛的，无限度的

specify
美[ˈspesɪfaɪ]
vt. 指定

tightly
美[ˈtaɪtli]
adv. 紧紧地

integrated
美[ˈɪntɪɡreɪtɪd]
adj. 结合的
```

```
Summary

SQS acts as a highly available buffer for data that must move between different application 
components. On the other hand, the Kinesis services collect, process, and store streaming, 
real-time binary data such as audio and video. Both SQS and the Kinesis services enable 
loose coupling.

loose
美[luːs]
adj. 松散的

coupling
美[ˈkʌplɪŋ]
n. 耦合
