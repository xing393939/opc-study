Tenancy

To meet special regulatory requirements, your organization’s instances might need an 
extra level of isolation. The Dedicated Instance option ensures that your instance will run 
on a dedicated physical server. This means that it won’t be sharing the server with resources
owned by a different customer account. The Dedicated Host option allows you to actually 
identify and control the physical server you’ve been assigned to meet more restrictive 
licensing or regulatory requirements.
